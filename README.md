# MyPage-CMS
A full-featured CMS written largely in procedural JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP. The codebase is a mess, the program is buggy as hell, and I would never write code this way again, but I'm still proud of it. It was an interesting little project, and I learned a ridiculous amount about programming by completing it. Here is a list of its features:
 
* Stylish admin area to create and edit low-bandwidth/high-performance websites.
* Sortable navigation bar.
* Responsive user-interface that works on any device.
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP allowed inside editor.
* Blog page with optional excerpts.
* Page and blog post versioning/backup system.
* Site information panel for clients.
* Nine fully responsive, professionally designed themes.
* Password-protected admin panel with reCAPTCHA to prevent brute-force intrusion.
* Secret questions-based password recovery system.
* File uploader which automatically generates image embed code and/or file download buttons.
* Secure PHP contact forms with reCAPTCHA spam-bot protection.
* Server-side visitor tracking (free Userstack and IPStack keys required) with optional IP blocking.
* Brute-force login protection via reCAPTCHA.
* No databases required.
* Option to hide pages in navigation bar.
* Code injection option to include code on all pages in website footer.
* Option to take website offline.
* Access logs that cannot be erased inside the admin panel.
* Troubleshooting options and log files.
* Python image gallery maker available as a separate, standlone download.
* High-performance, responsive lightbox image galleries for use with the image gallery maker Mac app/Python script, that make extensive use of preloading to give users a fast, seamless photo-browsing experience even while viewing extremely high-res images. Also includes a noscript fallback so that galleries can be viewed even if a user has disabled JavaScript.
* MyPage image gallery maker app for Mac (available here)!
* Contact form spam protection, that checks emails against a list of commonly used spam keywords and sends spam mails to spam@www.yourdomain.com instead of mail@www.yourdomain.com, allowing you to set up a spam filter in a program like Gmail.
* Option to get an email alert with detailed tracking information when someone visits all or specific webpages on your website.
* Option to block your own visits by setting a cookie that tells the CMS' tracking feature to ignore visits from your browser.
* Options to export your tracking data (all or individual days) as a beautiful HTML page which can be printed as a PDF.
* Inbuilt tracker blocks several common crawlers so that they won't pollute your tracking data.
